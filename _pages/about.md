I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST advised by Professor Dongsu Han. **I am currently looking for a US-based tech company located in the Bay Area or Seattle**.

My research interests are broadly in networked systems and machine learning (ML) systems. Recently, my work has focused on applying ML to large-scale networked systems (especially video) to drastically improve the performance. In particular, I have worked on two research directions - 1) ML-powered video streaming [HotNets'17, OSDI'18]: build new video streaming that applies neural quality enhancement to video utilizing client computation, and 2) Systems for large-scale ML [SIGCOMM'20, MobiCom'20, SIGCOMM'22]: build resource-efficient training and inference frameworks to enable ML-powered video streaming on larger scales.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
