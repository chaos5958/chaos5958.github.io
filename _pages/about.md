I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST advised by Professor Dongsu Han. My research interests are broadly in networked systems and machine learning (ML) systems. Recently, my work has focused on applying ML to large-scale networked systems (especially video) to drastically improve the performance. In particular, I have worked on two research directions - 1) AI for systems[HotNets'17, OSDI'18]: incorporate ML with existing systems, and 2) Systems for AI[SIGCOMM'20, MobiCom'20, SIGCOMM'22]: accelerate ML-augmented systems at scale.

**I'm currently looking for a US-based tech company located in the Bay Area or Seattle**, where I can tackle challenging problems by building hyper-scale systems that have a huge real-world impact.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
