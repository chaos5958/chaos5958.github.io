I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST advised by Professor Dongsu Han. I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST.

My research interests are broadly in networked systems and machine learning (ML) systems. Recently, my work has focused on applying ML to networked systems (especially video) to handle the fundamental limitations of traditional systems. In particular, I worked on two research directions - 1) AI for systems: incorporate ML with existing networked systems in a way that maximizes the benefit from ML, and 2) Systems for AI: accelerate and scale-out ML-augmented networked systems to make them more practical. 

**I'm currently on the job market.** I'm looking for a **tech company located in the Bay Area or Seattle** where I can learn new things, tackle challenging problems, and build hyper-scale systems that have a real-world impact. Feel free to contact me!


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
