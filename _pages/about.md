I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST advised by <a href='https://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/'>Professor Dongsu Han</a>.
I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. 

My research interests are incorporating deep learning (DL) techniques with computing and networking systems to drastically improve performance.
Recently, I have focused on 1) leveraging neural quality enhancement to make video systems more efficient and 2) accelerating neural enhancement to enable it on large-scale, distributed applications.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
